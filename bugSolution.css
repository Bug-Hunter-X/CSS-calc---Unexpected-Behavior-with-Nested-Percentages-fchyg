To solve the issue of unexpected behavior when using `calc()` with nested percentages, it's crucial to ensure the percentage is calculated relative to the correct parent element.  In this case, using `vw` units can explicitly set the reference point to the viewport width.

```css
.container {
  width: 50vw;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(50vw - 10px);
}
```

By using `vw` for the container's width, the `calc()` function will correctly subtract 10px from 50% of the viewport width, which gives more predictable results.  Alternatively, more complex solutions might involve using JavaScript to dynamically calculate the width based on the parent element's dimensions.
