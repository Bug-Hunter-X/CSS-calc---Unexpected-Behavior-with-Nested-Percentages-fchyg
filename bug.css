The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results when dealing with percentages within nested calculations. For example, the following CSS might not render as expected:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

The `calc(50% - 10px)` might not subtract the 10px correctly from the 50% of the *container's* width, but rather from the 50% of the *viewport* width.
